## Introduction
AV Pipeline Kit is a system for easier media app development. It contains a framework that parses plugin orchestration logic from each configuration file to create a pipeline with capabilities such as media playback, recording, or editing. Each plugin in a pipeline undertakes specific tasks, for example, demuxing, decoding, and filtering.
AV Pipeline Kit presets pipelines for scenarios like video playback, video super-resolution, and sound event detection, and it provides Java APIs for you to use these pipelines. You can also call a single preset plugin directly through C++ APIs. If you want to achieve more functions other than those provided by the preset plugins or pipelines, you can even customize some plugins or pipelines based on your own needs.
